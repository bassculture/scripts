BC-H.1	BC-W.R1	A Selection of Scots Reels Minuets	"Riddell, John"	composer		"AYR. GUL copy of 2nd edn has typed index comparing 1st and 2nd edns by ""D.C."" [this is most probably Davidson Cook, who sold the only known copy for 10 pounds (less discount) on 1/10/37 to NLS, according to loose sheet in NLS copy of 1st edn. Also says that 'is the earliest collection of Scots Dance Music bearing the name of the composer on its title-page.']   GORE indexes 2nd edition but uses title from 1st edn.  2nd edition:  Book starts with sequence of Minuets, one with 2 vln parts: 2nd part often higher than the 1st (and printed above it). The Dutchess of  Hamiltons Reel is actually a jig, with curious articulations in the tune. Minuet basslines are elegant and interesting, those for reels and strathspeys generally repeated crotchets. The Highway to Coilsfield has useful bowing. A few tunes also appear transposed for the German Flute (with no bass). The Highway to Criagie House, great slip jig with interesting binary bass. DATABASE (also 1st edn for comparison from NLS). Mostly reels after initial sequenece of minuets: some jigs (called reels). Miss Peggy Montgomerie's Hornpipe has Gs going up and G#s going down in the tune! Isolated minuet-type tune The Troon House has more baroque bassline in amongst the simple repeated crotchets elsewhere."			BC-B.R1	"A Selection of Scots Reels Minuets &c.

BC-H.2	BC-W.C1	A Collection of Strathspey or old Highland Reels	"Cumming, Angus"			"Cumming of GRANTOWN, self-pubd in Edinburgh. from subscribers list, everyone called Grant on the globe bought one (astonishing), also 'the celebrated' James McPherson and Tytler. Preface about Strathspey and primitivism. Invercald's Reel like McGlashan but finishing in D each strain. Much use of dotted rhythms, though good variety of single note patterns, and some piano chords, octaves and dyads. Fairly sparse provision of trills, even fewer grace notes.  NB inconsistencies in the way Cumming prints end of strain and upbeat of next - sometimes adds up to a full bar of 8 quavers, but sometimes not.  Confidently chosen tunes. long variation set on Reell of Tulloch, also 'Beggar's Bennison' DATABASE prefatory material supplied in photocopy in GUL copy. A number of copies.  Perth copy is good but titlepage is torn - where is there a Glasgow edition to check?   Need to check GUL and Mitchell to establish whether either or both are Glasgow edition.  Perth's TP torn and repaired with pencilled text, but original says Edbg 1780.  However we know the Glasgow one was 1782.  GUL copy lacks prefatory material. large landscape format"	Full Info	http://www.scottishmusicindex.org/index.asp?view=sources&id=39	BC-B.C1	A Collection of Strathspey or old Highland Reels			D7686	D2	1st edition	20pp		26	35	1780	Edinburgh								Glasgow University Library	GB-Gu	Ca11-y.24		GB-Gm	M8755
